A Physics Simulation written in HTML and Javascript in two weeks. It demonstrates the two types of friction and how they affect an object's motion. To use it, download the file, unzip it, then right click on "index.html" -> Open With -> Google Chrome (or other browser). 

For more details on how to use it, you can see here:

Problems:

I can't create a reset() button to reset the game but instead, the user has to refresh the whole page. I tried to look for solutions but people say that I need another language called JQuery to do this. I found only one solution in Javascript but it is too advanced for me to understand.

I can't find a solution to disabling the "Play" button when the user clicks it. If the user double clicks then the game doesn't behave correctly.
