# ISU---Friction-Simulator
A Physics Simulation written in HTML and Javascript in two weeks.

Problems:
1. I can't create a reset() button to reset the game but instead, the user has to refresh the whole page. I tried to look for solutions but people say that I need another language called JQuery to do this. I found only one solution in Javascript but it is too advanced for me to understand.

2. I can't find a solution to disabling the "Play" button when the user clicks it. If the user double clicks then the game doesn't behave correctly.
